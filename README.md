# Fort Vox Voice Box
Fort Vox Voice Box is a box locked by a voice password. Admin can set the voice password. Users can try and break it. If they are successful, the box will unlock to reveal a prize. 
The main code is myVoskCheck.py Working on adding the raspberry pi image. The libraries are pyaudio, luma.oled, vox, gpiozero, tbc. The respeaker hat is very old and doesn't work with the Raspberry Pi 5 or the latest versions of the Raspberry Pi OS.
